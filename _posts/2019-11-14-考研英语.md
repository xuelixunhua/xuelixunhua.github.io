## 1.1 五种单词记忆法

1.词根词缀法

2.激情联想法

3.根源记忆法

4.场景记忆法

5.类比记忆法：近义类比、近形类比

## 1.2 个人看法

这五种方法在小时候最喜欢用激情联想法，什么“俺必胜”" ambition "一类的，那时候最喜欢在课本上记各种汉语发音，还得防止老师看见，现在不怎么喜欢用这种了，因为没有什么必须要记住的单词，有了也是靠艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线的原理多看几遍来记住。

现在最常用的则是场景记忆法，因为个人没有考 GRE 、专八的需求，对词汇量没有太多的要求，更多是金融专业词汇和区块链词汇，这些在场景里记住就很难忘了，就像是期货与期权的段子：future and option , 以为是关于人生未来道路选择的课，结果发现全是数学推导的课。

应付考试最好用的方法莫过于总结类比记忆了，这个可以轻松掌握大量意思或者形状相近的单词，也可以快速掌握大量熟词僻意，而考研一大考点就是熟词僻意，只不过找这些整理好的材料比较困难，尤其是初高中学生。

词根词缀法和根源记忆法是在一次集训营中的李达老师（公众号：达达英语）讲述的，对于我这个没有接触过词汇学的学生来说着实惊艳，仿佛打开了一个新的大门，其实以前是接触过词根词缀，但苦于没有系统的学习系统和老师也不提倡，只是知道一些词根而已，比如：ab- , re- , con- 等等，这次老师一个个讲词根词缀，的确学到了很多，如果有机会把这些词根词缀都学会再去认识单词估计就轻松多了。

根源记忆法老师讲的更多是希腊故事的例子，比如 academic 这个单词是希腊英雄 Akademos 因为避免了一次战争而得到神灵的庇佑，他的橄榄树林因此得名，之后柏拉图在这里创建学院，academic 就代表了学院的意思，以上两种记忆方法适用于对英语有一定兴趣且有一定基础的同学来用。

总体来说，如果以时间先后顺序推荐：激情联想法--场景记忆法--类比记忆法--根源记忆法--词根词缀法。

## 1.3 前缀、后缀与词根

前缀表方向；

后缀表词性；

词根表含义。

### 1.3.1 所有前缀都可表强调

**a 开头的前缀**

1.a + 字母- 去；使

字母 = 与后面词根首字母相同

如：ab-breviate 缩写  ac-cept 接受  at-tract 吸引  ap-point 任命  ac-cess 进入

2.ab- 远离

如：ab-dicate 退位  ab-stract 抽象  ab-use 滥用

3.a- 否定

如：ab-normal 不正常的

4.所有前缀都可表强调

### 1.3.2 表示数字的前缀

mono-  表“一” monologue 自言自语  monopoly 垄断

bi-(di-/du-)  表“二” bisexual 双性的

tri-  表“三”  triple 三倍的

quart-  表“四”  quarter 四分之一的；季度

pent-  表“五”  pentagon 五边形

hex-(sex-)  表“六” hexagon = sexangle 六边形

sept-  表“七”  September 九月

oct-  表“八”  October 十月

nov-  表“九”  November 十一月

dec-  表“十”  December 十二月 decay 腐烂 decade 十年

Julias 凯撒  凯撒大帝修改历法，下令以自己的名字作为七月的名字，于是就有了 July

Augustos 奥古斯都  奥古斯都大帝接任凯撒大帝的位置，同样下令以自己的名字作为历法的明自，就有了八月 August.

## 1.4 词汇变形原则

**1.元音互换**

元音：a o e i u

例子：-ant = -ent   -able = -ible   -ual = -ial

实例：ann -- enn 

**2.清浊互换**

k(c)-g   t-d   f-v   p-b

例子：act = ag   eat = ed   lev = lif

实例：lever -- lift

**3.音近互换**

r-l   l-n

例子：bor = bol   con- = col- = cor-

实例：abortion -- abolish

中文实例：蓝瘦--难受  无fuck说--无话可说

**4.形近互换**

v-w   m-n  b-d

例子：vad = wad   im- = in-   bi- = di-

**5.省略/脱落**

1) 元音

2) 弱读辅音：m/n/h/t/d

# 阅读

## 3.1 做题步骤

1. 给文章标段落
2. 先题后文，串联题干，避免选项干扰
3. 阅读题干，回文定位
4. 圈住转折词
5. 详读略读，寻找主旨，细节服从主旨，反复强调的是重点

其中，**转折词**除了but, however, while之类的词外，还包括**时间**上的词如**now**, 因为时间相反，一切相反；另外还有隐形转折，如 in fact, in effect, actually, fortunately, unfortunately, strangely 这些词

学会抓住作者的**态度**，根据形容词、副词来判断，有正面/负面之分

**全文主旨**：开门见山(开头1-2句)/抛砖引玉(比较，故事，引述，第一段末或第二段开头)/话锋一转(转折)/设问回答(如果首段出现问号，则该文统领全文)/串联全文首末句

**段落主旨**：首句/转折后/如是例子，找前一句/总结后是主旨/词汇复现率高的信息

把握段落间、句子间的**逻辑**，有相同/相反之分，无转折词则优先考虑相同逻辑

详读内容：主旨句；观点态度；转折处；让步处；比较处；否定处；倒装处；冒号处

略读内容：修饰成分(人物和机构的介绍)；大篇幅的举例子(段中出现人名、地名、专有名词、数字、大量年份)；实验和研究的过程；两个逗号、破折号之间的插入语

## 3.2 题型总结

### 3.2.1 词汇题

1. 标志：“???” (line, paragraph) most probablly means.
2. 方法：通过定位好的句子，根据逻辑关系找同义词或反义词
3. 干扰项特征：字面意思理解

### 3.2.2 中心思想题

1. 标志：mainly about, discuss, the best/appropriate title, the purpose
2. 方法：串线、中心句、中心词
3. 干扰项特征：范围太小；范围太大则以标题作文

串线：将各段首末句串连成一个整体，注意转折处

中心句：问题开头的提问，对它的回答是文章的中心句；独句段是文章中心

中心词：文中反复高频出现的词及同义表达

### 3.2.3 例证题

1. 标志：example, case, illustrate, demonstrate, to show, to ____
2. 例子本身不重要，重要的是例子所支持的观点；观点一般在例子前，有时也在例子后
3. 干扰项特征：就事论事讲例子本身

### 3.2.4 作者态度题

1. 标志：attitude, deem, consider, tone
2. 方法：选项词汇归纳
3. 当作者的态度没有明确提出时：文章的框架；形容词、副词；转折处；情态动词之后

选项词汇归纳：

**正面**：positive, optimistic, approval, supportive

**负面**：negative, pessimistic, disapproval, critical, doubtful, suspious, skeptical, questionable, objectionable

**中立**：neutral, objective, impartial, disinterested

**不选**：uninterested, unconcerned, indifferent, confused, puzzled, biased, prejudice, contemptuous, subjective

### 3.2.5 细节题

1. 标志：what, how, why(because / because of / in that等) + 具体信息
2. 定位好的句子是解题的最为重要的依据，有时结合上下句
3. 同义改写的考察目的：背单词
4. 干扰项特征：绝对化用词如only, must, exclusively, never, all; 审题仔细——答非所问；细节题不是连连看，读懂句子排除相反或偷换概念(常由文中出现的单词拼凑成相反的意思)

### 3.2.6 推理判断题

1. 标志：infer, learn from, imply, suggest, conclude
2. 方法：同义改写——细节/主旨/逻辑；逻辑取反——推理多在转折处
3. 正确答案往往语气缓和：may

## 3.3 正确选项特征

1. 同义改写——本质是考察词汇量
2. 与中心思想密切相关——细节服从主旨
3. 语气缓和——some, may, partly(注意结合文章，非绝对情况)
4. 最佳答案更具概括性——具体举例的答案通常不是
5. 互为相反的选项，必有一个为正确选项

**收敛思维——不要推理**

### 4.1.2 做题步骤

1. 理解前后句（如果前后句有空，要先补全）
2. 根据前后句判断关系

### 4.1.3 考察内容

对立（包括转折和让步）> 因果（包括原因和结果）> 并列 > 举例 > 递进 > 条件

其中，转折与让步为同性，原因与结果非同性

### 4.1.4 六大逻辑关系标志词

对立：

* 转折：but / yet / however / on the contrary = conversely / by contrast = in contrast / **or** / unfortunately / whereas / nevertheless

* 让步：still / although / though / **even** / even though = even if / even when / in spite of = despite = much as / **as** / **while**  


* 其他：against / instead of / rather than / ignoring / in return (some…others…)


因果：		

* 原因：because / because of / in that / **as** / for / as a result of = due to = owing to / in response to / considering / according to / since / **while** 

* 结果：so that = such that / as a result = as a consequence = consequently = therefore = hence = thus = accordingly / so / in effect 
	
并列：and = as well as / then / **or** / in turn / likewise / simultaneously / meanwhile / similarly / **while**
	
举例：for example = for instance = such as / including 
	
递进：also / indeed / furthermore = moreover / highlighting / in particular = particularly = especially / **even**
	
条件：if / only if / unless / as long as = so long as / supposed = supposing = providing = provided / with / only when

### 4.1.5 对立关系的重点

1. **标点原理**：though, for example, for instance, in fact, indeed, in effect 要做插入语，放入句中前后要有标点隔开。
2. **判断对立标准**：
  
i. 意思判断：前后意思相反或相对；
    
ii. 句式结构判断：前肯后否或前否后肯( not 题)
	
[注意]：not必须是整体否定，局部否定不成立

### 4.1.6 举例关系

1. 先总说再分说（看意思）
2. 先复数再单数

### 4.1.7 递进关系

1. 意思判断
2. 先原型再比较级

### 4.1.8 逻辑关系变体(新趋势)

与逻辑关系题相反：直接给出逻辑关系词，根据逻辑关系来选择适合的实词

### 4.1.9 直选法

前提条件：选项只有**一**个标志词

解题策略：1. 将其直接勾上；2. 带回原文验证

## 4.2 同义原则

1. 两个实词，互为**同义词或同形词**时，答案在其中，**两词辨析取其短，一样长短取其熟**；互为**反义词**时，答案在其中，技巧同上。
2. 两个虚词，互为**同义词或近义词**时，答案都不选；有**相同逻辑关系**时，答案都不选。

## 4.3 通用性解题方法

### 4.3.1 表语原则

1. **系动词**：be, look, feel, seem, smell, taste, sound, become, turn, keep, remain
2. 看到系动词，用表语原则；选项看词性，具体分情况；找出句主语，只看主系表
3. **具体情况**：当所选表语是名词时，他和主语是对等关系；当所选表语是形容词时，他和主语是修饰关系

### 4.3.2 并列词分析法

**并列标志词**前完整部分和其后含有未知空，或颠倒；**标志词**前后要成为并列相关的意群

### 4.3.3 从句解题法

当空后面出现**从句**时（定语从句和同位语从句），该从句一定是线索；分词作状语表示解释说明

## 4.4 实词题方法

最主要的还是认识选项与句子的意思，没有太多技巧。

## 4.5 蒙

### 4.5.1 低级蒙法

高频**虚词必选词**：

1等：although, however, yet, because

2等：indeed, while, even, against

高频**实词必选词**：

Necessary, shape, equal, predict, among, mean, explain, absent, common

高频**必不选词**：

1. 虚拟语气词：if only, now that, in case, lest, or else
2. 表示关于的词：as to / for, with reference to, in reference to, with regard to

### 4.5.2 中级蒙法

**理论基础**：没有连续三个答案都一样的情况；在五个一组的答案中，最少出现四个字母作为正确的选项；在每组答案接缝处没有连续两个答案都一样的情况

故1-5不确定的选A，6-10不确定的选B，以此类推。

### 4.5.3 高级蒙法

**宗旨**：先把肯定的选上，剩下的补全

若某组选了A, C两个选项，则剩下的补B；所补选项往下轮，如所选为C, D两个选项，则剩下的补A。

## 4.6 总结

**虚词题**：

1. 高频必选词
2. 标点原理
3. 虚词的同义同性词都不选
4. 直选法
5. not 题，前肯后否，前否后肯
6. 通读前后句

**实词题**：

1. 特殊词如同义/同形/反义，选短的
2. 一般词用表语原则、并列词分析法和从句解题法

# 新题型

## 5.0 综述与个人观点

英语二新题型分为**段落与标题匹配**与**人物与观点匹配**，相比英语一新题型所考难度极低，也是英语一与英语二得分情况相差最大的题型。

**段落与标题匹配**：

1. 细读小标题，总结关键词(名词为主)
2. 扫读段落，总结关键词
3. 进行匹配

**人物与观点匹配**：

1. 细读人物和观点
2. 回文划出所有人物并标题号，附近一定有线索，注意后方代词指代
3. 连连看

* 个人观点：虽然相比英语一简单很多很多，但我在做题的时候还是有错选的情况，比如第一种题型经常找错误，第二种题型较简单，但2011年的考题需要上下文隔很远才能找到答案。因此建议还是在准备过程中通翻全文，熟悉行文风格以便考试时能够最快速地看懂文章并选对答案。

## 6.1 前言

**翻译要点**：

1. 不胡说——准确
2. 是句子——完整
3. 像人话——通顺

**提高方法**：

1. 提高双语水平
2. 了解汉英对比(道)
3. 掌握相应技巧(术)
4. 必须身体力行

**翻译**：在译入语中寻找源语最通顺的情况。

## 6.2 汉英对比

### 6.2.1 形和意和

![差异](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuelixunhua/xuelixunhua.github.io/main/assets\images\articles\kaoyan\英语\2\差异.png)

**语法差异**：

1. 英文名词必须体现数，带冠词，而汉语不用。I like dogs. He is a teacher.
2. 英文常用代词，汉语很少使用。He came in with his hands in his pockets.
3. 英文动词必须体现出时态、语态、语气、数的概念，汉语不用。Even if I were to beaten to death, I would not say.
4. 英文每个句子都必须有一个主谓结构，若两个句子连到一起，则必须有连接词，而汉语不必要。If winter comes, can spring be far behind?

**方法论**：

1. 省略冠词和数词
2. 把代词省略或者替换
3. 动词的很多语法点视情况取舍
4. 省略连接词

### 6.2.2 语序差异

#### 6.2.2.1 定语位置

**方法论**：前置；若冗长，断句；注意音律美

a research-oriented hospital 研究型医院

something important 重要的事

a canddidate with little chance of success 当选希望渺茫的候选人

#### 6.2.2.2 状语位置

**方法论**：时间-地点-方法

英语中经常‘方法-地方-时间’，汉语相反

Yesterday, I saw Tom and Joan go hand in hand into the cinema.

#### 6.2.2.3 叙事顺序

**方法论**：时间先后/空间大小/因果前后

He had flown in just the day before from Georgia where he had spent his vacation basking in the Caucasian sun after the completion of the construction job he had been engaged on in the South.

他本来在南方从事建筑工作，完成后，去格鲁吉亚度假享受沐浴阳光，前天才飞回来。

#### 6.2.2.4 重心位置

汉语：左分支，后重心，狮子头

英语：右分支，左重心，孔雀尾

### 6.2.3 语态差异

汉语中多为主动语态，被动语态中超过百分之七十都表示消极意义。

英语中的被动语态则对于表达积极、中性、消极没有明显的偏好。

故**方法论**为**将被动语态变为主动语态**，具体方法如下：

1. 去"被"字
2. 换"被"字
3. 增主语
4. 换主语
5. 判断句
6. 无主句

#### 6.2.3.1 去"被"字

The job is done. 

工作做完了。

Solution to the problem was ultimately found. 

终于找到了问题的解决方法。

Unless something is moved, no work is done. 

除非物体发生移动，否则不会做功。= 只有物体移动，才会做功。

Only objects struck by the light are visible. 

只有光照到的物体才是可见的。

#### 6.2.3.2 换"被"字

受、得、加以、予以等都可以替换

The old should be respected everywhere. 

老年人应当处处受到尊重。

These problems should be resolved at an appropriate time with an appropriate means. 

这些问题应该在合适的时间用恰当的方式加以解决。

Our prisoners of war must be repatriated without further delay. 

我们的战俘必须立刻予以遣返。

#### 6.2.3.3 增主语

英语经常避免主语，假如动词表示观点、情感、态度、话语可以在句子里增加一个范指性的主语，如我们、有人、这个等

The lecture is considered very improtant for beginners. 

大家认为这场讲座对于初学者很重要。

Some things have been said here tonight that ought not to have been spoken. 

今晚有人在此说了不该说的话。

The maximum demand for electricity today is expected to doble within a decade. 

我们预期最大用电需求量会在十年内翻倍。

#### 6.2.3.4 换主语

把原句的状语变成主语，把原句的主语变成宾语。

Friction can be reduced and the life of the machine prolonged by lubrication. 

润滑可以减少摩擦，延长机器寿命。

I was astounded that he was prepared to give me a job. 

他愿意给我一份工作让我很震惊。

#### 6.2.3.5 判断句

原句没有被动含义，说的是事实。写成判断句，如 A 是 B 的 xx 。

History is made by the people. 

历史是人民创造的。

The credit system in America was first adopted by Harvard University in 1872. 

美国的学分制是1872年哈佛大学首先采用的。

#### 6.2.3.6 无主句

A force is needed to stop a moving body. 

为了使运动的物体停下来就需要力。

Six hours' sleep must be ensured. 

必须保证六个小时的睡眠。

### 6.2.4 物称人称

英文喜欢用物来做主语，汉语喜欢用人来做主语，故**方法论**为**物称变人称**。

Excitement deprived me of all words. 

我激动得说不出话来。

The whole devastating experience sharpened my appreciation of the world around me. 

经历了这场灾难，我更懂得了欣赏周围的世界。 

The forty years, 1840-80, brought almost ten million migrants to America. 

在1840-1880这四十年间，约有一千万移民来到美国。

American education owes a great debt to Thomas Jefferson. 

杰弗逊为美国教育做出了巨大贡献。

### 6.2.5 静态动态

静态变动态，英文喜欢用n, prep, adj , adv 来表示弱势v, 即 have, be 等，而中文几乎事事都可以用动词表示。

故**方法论**为**名词变动词**。

High blood pressure is a contradiction for this drug. 

高血压患者忌服此药。

Laser is one of the most sensational developments in recent years, because of its applicability to many fields of science and its adaptability to practical uses. 

激光是近些年中最使人激动的发明之一，因为它可以应用于科学的很多方面，适用于实际用途。

The doctor's extreme quick arrival and uncommonly careful examine of the patient brought about his very speedy recovery. 

医生迅速赶到并非常仔细地检查了病人，这使得病人很快康复了.

His familiarity with many rarely used languages surprised us all. 

他熟悉各种罕见语言，这使我们很震惊。

During the wartime, years like these would have meant certain death for many people. Many would have become beggars and others would have been compelled to sell their children. 

在战争期间，要是遇上这种年景，很多人将必死无疑。很多人可能会沦为乞丐，其他人将被迫卖儿鬻女。


## 6.3 必会技巧

### 6.3.1 词义选择和引申

举例如 last, 作动词有'持续'的意思，作形容词有'最后的'意思，引申为'最不可能的'

He is the last man to come. 

他是最后一个来的。

He is the last person for such a job. 

他是最不适合这样的工作的人。

The meeting lasted 2 hours. 

会议持续了两个小时。

### 6.3.2 词的增删

英文喜欢并列句，常省略；汉语喜欢缺失，常有不完整句。

范畴词：现象，问题，因素等；凑齐音律，汉语很少有抽象名词。

对于代词，汉语不喜欢。

**方法论**：

1. 翻译时加上并列句省略的词语
2. 不必强求主谓宾结构，能说通即可
3. 凑齐音律，在汉语词汇后加范畴词表示抽象名词
4. 对于代词，重复/替代/省略

We don't retreat; we never have; and never will. 

我们从不退却，我们从未退却，今后也决不退却。

Courage in excess many become foolhardiness; prudence cowardice; thrift avarice; and tolerance weakness. 

过度的勇气会变成鲁莽，过度的谨慎会变成懦弱，过度的节俭会变成贪婪，而且过度的容忍会变成软弱。

大国有大国的战略，小国有小国的路线。

Unemployment is more serious in the country. 

该国失业问题更严重。

We live and learn.

我们这样说万无一失。

The first bombs missed the target. 

第一颗炸弹没击中目标。

The islanders found themselves far from ready to fight the war. 

岛民们发现自己远没有做好战斗准备。

I can't care less about the payment. 

我一点都不关心报酬。

### 6.3.4 分译合译

分译：词汇或表达要么非常生硬，要么没有对应搭配，可先不管，秋后算账。

Jerry quickly ordered everyone to put on life Jackets, and tried unsuccessfully to put out the fire. 

杰瑞迅速命令大家穿上救生衣并迅速灭火，却无济于事。

For 20 years we were passive witness to the deterioration of prices of our raw materials and an excessive increase of the prices of manufactured goods.

众所周知，铜是一种良导体。

Most U.S spy satellited are designed to burn up in the earth's atmosphere after completing their missions. 

大部分美国间接卫星按其设计在完成任务后会在地球大气层中焚毁。

### 6.3.5 定从翻译

* 前置法

尽可能前置；若冗长，断句

The musician who played at the concert is from China.

在音乐会上演奏的音乐家来自中国。

* 后置法

Gasoline is a fuel whose vapor is readily explosive.

汽油是一种燃料，其蒸汽容易爆炸。

* 翻译成状语从句

We know that a cat, whose eyes can take in many more rays of light than our eyes, can see clearly in the night. 

我们知道由于猫的眼睛可以比我们吸收更多的光线，所以可以在晚上看得清楚。

## 6.4 总结

1. 形和意和：省略冠词、数词、连接词，省略或替换代词
2. 语序：定语前置，若冗长则断句，注意音律美，状语按“时间-地点-方法”来，叙事顺序为时间先后，空间大小，因果前后来，后重心
3. 语态：被动语态主动化，去'被'字、换'被'字、增主语、换主语、判断句、无主句
4. 物称人称：物称变人称
5. 静态动态：名词变动词
6. 注意词义选择和引申
7. 增删：加上并列句省略的词，不必强求主谓宾结构，加上范畴词如现象、因素来表示范畴词，重复、替代或省略代词
8. 正反译法
9. 分译合译
10. 定从翻译：前置，若冗长则断句，即后置，或翻译成状语从句

## 6.5 翻译步骤

1. 切分顺译
2. 调整变换
3. 增删润色

其中第二点主要在于识别考点、调整句式、踩点得分。

着重观察其语法语序、是否被动、物称静态。

当印度的信息技术公司建立本地中心以便服务全球客户时，它们发现，如果中国软件专业的本科和硕士生群体不能熟练使用英语，进入中国市场终将是徒劳无功的。


## 6.6 真题演练

### 2010

'Sustainability' has become a popular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal meaning. Having endured a painful period of unsustainability in his own life made it clear to him that sustainability-oriented values must be expressed through everyday action and choice.

Ning recalled spending a confusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance. He'd been through the dot-com boom and burst and, desperate for a job, signed on with a Boulder agency.

It didn't go well. "It was a really bad move because that's not my passion," says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. "I was miserable. I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, 'Just wait, you'll turn the corner, give it some time.'"

这段时间“可持续性”已经成为了一个流行词，但对于 Ted Ning 来说，这个概念一直都会有独特的含义。他亲身经历过过一段痛苦的难以为继的时光，这使他很清楚以持续性为导向的价值观必须通过日常的行为和选择体现出来。

Ning 记得在90年代末卖过一年保险，那一年他非常迷茫。在此之前，他经历了互联网的兴衰。由于迫切想要一份工作，他签约了一家宝德公司的办事处。

工作并不顺利，Ning说，“这绝对是招臭棋，因为我对这份工作没有兴趣。”可想而知，他在工作中进退维谷，导致业绩不佳。“我当时很痛苦，我非常焦虑，常会在半夜醒来，盯着天花板发呆。我身无分文所以需要这份工作，每个人都说，‘再等等吧，你会克服的，再等一段时间吧’。”

### 2011

Who would have thought that, globally, the IT industry produces about the same volume of greenhouse gases as the world's airlines do—roughly 2 percent of all C02 emissions?

Many everyday tasks takes a surprising toll on the environment. A Google search can leak between 0.2 and 7.0 grams of C02, depending on how many attempts are needed to get the "right" answer. To deliver results to its users quickly, then, Google has to maintain vast data centers around the world, packed with powerful computers. While producing large quantities of C02, these computers emit a great deal of heat, so the centers need to be well air-conditioned, which uses even more energy? 

However, Google and other big tech providers monitor their efficiency closely and make improvements. Monitoring is the first step on the road to reduction, but there is much more to be done, and not just by big companies. 

谁会想到全球信息技术产业与全世界航空公司产生的温室气体总量大约是相同的呢——信息技术产业排放的二氧化碳约占2%？

许多日常活动会给环境带来巨大的伤害。一次谷歌搜索会排放0.2-7克的二氧化碳，这取决于得到正确答案需要几步。为了迅速把结果传送给用户，谷歌不得不在全世界维护装满了大型计算机的数据中心。在产生大量二氧化碳的同时，这些计算机又散发着大量的热，因此数据中心需要大量空调，这又会消耗着更多的能源。

然而，谷歌和其他大型科技提供商密切地监测其效率并作出改进，监测是减排之路的第一步，但需要做的还有很多，而且也不能只依靠大公司。

### 2012

When people in developing countries worry about migration, they are usually concerned at the prospect of their best and brightest departure to Silicon Valley or to hospitals and universities in the developed world. These are the kind of workers that countries like Britain, Canada and Australia try to attract by using immigration rules that privilege college graduates. 
    
Lots of studies have found that well-education people form developing countries are particularly likely to emigrate. A big survey of Indian households in 2004 found that nearly 40% of emigrants had more than a high-school education, compared with around 3.3% of all Indians over the age of 25. This "brain drain" has long bothered policymakers in poor counties. They fear that it hurts their economies, depriving them of much-needed skilled worker who could taught at their universities, worked in their hospital and come up with clever new product for their factories to make. 

当发展中国家的人们考虑移民的时候，通常会憧憬着离开故国去往硅谷或者是发达国家的医院与大学，前途大好一片光明。像英国、加拿大和澳大利亚之类的国家对大学毕业生给予优惠的移民政策，正是为了吸引上述这种工人。

许多研究显示，发展中国家的高学历人群最有可能移民。2004年一项针对印度家庭的大样本调查发现将近40%的移民受过高中以上的教育，相比之下，25岁以上的所有的印度人只有大约3.3%有高中以上学历。这种“人才流失”的现象长时间困扰着发展中国家的政策制定者。他们害怕这会损害其经济，丧失急需的熟练工人，而这些工人本可以在本国的大学教书，在自己的医院工作，研发新的先进产品让他们的工厂去生产。


### 2013

I can pick a date from the past 53 years and know instantly where I was, what happened in the news and even the day of the week. I've been able to do this since I was four. 

I never feel overwhelmed with the amount of information my brain absorbs. My mind seems to be able to cope and the information is stored away neatly. When I think of a sad memory, I do what everybody does - try to put it to one side. I don't think it's harder for me just because my memory is clearer. Powerful memory doesn't make my emotions any more acute or vivid. I can recall the day my grandfather died and the sadness I felt when we went to the hospital the day before. I also remember that the musical Hair opened on Broadway on the same day - they both just pop into my mind in the same way. 

从过去53年中我能任挑一天立刻想起自己当时身处何地，新闻里发生了什么事件，甚至那天是周几。自从4岁的时候我就可以这样做了。

我从不会因为大脑吸收了大量信息而感到不堪重负。我的大脑似乎可以处理大量信息并将其有序地储存起来。当我想起一段伤心的回忆时，和大家一样——我都会把它搁置一旁，我觉得我并没有因为记忆更清晰而比别人更难放下。我记忆力超群，但我的感情却并未因此格外敏锐，抑或生动。我记得祖父去世那天的情形，我也记得前一天去医院的时候悲痛万分。我还记得就在同一天音乐剧“头发”在百老汇上演，这两件事同时跃入脑海，别无二致。

### 2014

Most people would define optimism as endlessly happy, with a glass that's perpetually half full. But that's exactly the kind of false cheerfulness that positive psychologists wouldn't recommend. "Healthy optimists means being in touch with reality." says Tal Ben-Shahar, a Harvard professor. According to Ben-Shahar, realistic optimists are these who make the best of things that happen, but not those who believe everything happens for the best. 

Ben-Shahar uses three optimistic exercises. When he feels down—say, after giving a bad lecture—he grants himself permission to be human. He reminds himself that not every lecture can be a Nobel winner; some will be less effective than others. Next is reconstruction. He analyzes the weak lecture, learning lessons for the future about what works and what doesn't. Finally, there is perspective, which involves acknowledging that in the grand scheme of life, one lecture really doesn't matter. 

大多数人认为乐观就是永远开心，就是永远看到杯子里还剩半杯水。但这恰恰是一种虚假快乐，而积极的心理学家是不会推荐这种快乐的。哈佛大学教授泰勒·本·沙哈说，“健康的乐观主义意味着要与现实相连。”根据本·沙哈，现实的乐观主义者是因势利导而非求全责备。

他用三种方式锻炼乐观，比如说，因演讲失败而心情低落，他会安慰自己，人非圣贤孰能无过。他提醒自己并非每场讲座都能获得诺贝尔奖；某些演讲的效果就不如其他的好。接下来就是重建，他会分析不好的演讲，为将来学习什么有效，什么无效。最后要培养这样一种观点：承认在生命的漫漫长河中，一场讲座无足轻重。

### 2015

Think about driving a route that's very familiar. It could be your commute to work, a trip into town or the way home. Whichever it is, you know every twist and turn like the back of your hand. On these sorts of trips it's easy to lose concentration on the driving and pay little attention to the passing scenery. The consequence is that you perceive that the trip has taken less time than it actually has. 

This is the well-travelled road effect: people tend to underestimate the time it takes to travel a familiar route.

The effect is caused by the way we allocate our attention. When we travel down a well-known route, because we don't have to concentrate much, time seems to flow more quickly. And afterwards, when we come to think back on it, we can't remember the journey well because we didn't pay much attention to it. So we assume it was shorter. 

设想你在熟悉的路上开车，这条路可能是你上班下班、回家的路，无论是哪条路，你都对每处蜿蜒曲折了如指掌。在此类路途中开车很容易分神，对沿途的风景也熟视无睹。结果就是你以为旅途花的时间比实际上少。

这就是“熟路效应”：人们倾向于低估在熟路上行驶所花费的时间。

我们分配自己注意力的方式导致了这种效应。当我们沿着熟路行驶，由于我们无需过多关注，时间似乎流失得更快。而后回想起来，我们就记不清旅途，因为没有过多关注它。所以我们误以为旅途更短。

### 2016

The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible within its doors. The reason for this is simple: The longer you stay in the store, the more stuff you'll see, and the more stuff you see, the more you'll buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff. The average supermarket, according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44,00 different items, and many carry tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload. According to brain-scan experiments, the demands of so much decision-making quickly become too much for us. After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people stop struggling to be rationally selective, and instead begin shopping emotionally — which is the point at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying. 

超市旨在吸引顾客在店里花费尽可能多的时间，原因很简单：待得越久，见的越多，见的越多，买的越多。超市拥有很多商品，根据食品营销协会的数据，普通超市大约拥有4400种不同的商品，而很多超市拥有多达数万种商品。人们得到的选择太多，这就足以让消费者目不暇接、眼花缭乱。根据脑部扫描实验，我们要做的决定太多，很快就难以应付。在购物四十分钟后，大部分人就不会再费力做出理性选择，相反开始冲动购物，此刻我们已经在手推车里堆了一半根本没想买的商品。

### 7.1.2 评分三眼

![三眼](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuelixunhua/xuelixunhua.github.io/main/assets\images\articles\kaoyan\英语\3\3.1.png)

以上需要注意的是阅卷老师会通读第一段，故第一段不要乱发挥，正常写不丢分就可以了；第二段会注意论点，因此要注意论点的层次性；最后一段通常不看，全段背诵默写上去即可。

概括起来，高分作文要做到：**字数达标、格式规范、逻辑严谨、内容充实、语法正确、不乏亮点**。

### 7.1.3 词汇

写作中用词讲究**精准化**和**多样化**，前者为了精确表达文意，一词切入内容；后者为了作文中重复性使用单一词汇而造成阅读疲劳。

#### 7.1.3.1 精准化

Clothes? suit/coat/jeans/dress/robe/costume

Bird? swallow/crow/pigeon/owl/eagle/hawk

Good? gorgeous/magnificent/outstanding

#### 7.1.3.2 多样化

多：a great quantity of, millions upon millions, numerous, plenty of, vast arrays of, a variety of

方法：way, means, method, approach, measure

大概：around, about, approximately

优点：merit, advantage, strong suit, strongpoint,virtue

缺点：disadvantage, defect, drawback, shortcoming, flaw, demerit

比较：A is superior to B, the advantages of A outweigh those of B, B pales in many aspects when compared with A



### 7.1.4 句式结构

关于以下涉及到的语法笔记详看[语法与长难句](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI1NTcxMzcxOA==&mid=2247484046&idx=1&sn=10fe2f61b9f64a4584be36c5da429694&chksm=ea308a57dd47034181948b2f81054e7d19819ec15369502d09e3a2b1d853122e5135c12aff28&token=2104640907&lang=zh_CN#rd)

写作中需要用词来构成句子，而句子的第一要素就是**没有语法错误**，常见的语法错误有主谓不一致、动词作主语等等，解决方法无非就是多读英语文章，读多了自然不会犯错，或者就是写完让别人批改。

第二要素是**句子的长**，考研英语都说长难句，句子的长度自然是评分标准之一了，如何写长呢？除了加形容词、副词等就是写复合句。

第三要素是**句子要变**，其实复合句本身没有什么令人惊艳之处，一个文章里用的多了也是千篇一律，为了让文章多点生气，写一些特殊句式如倒装、插入语等等就能让文字千变万化。

![投诉](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuelixunhua/xuelixunhua.github.io/main/assets\images\articles\kaoyan\英语\3\投诉.png)

To Whom It May Concern,

I am sb., a <u>user of xx / customer of xx / resident in xx</u>. I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with <u>your product / your service / the 环境问题</u>.

My complaints mainly lie in the following aspects. On the one hand,

产品: I was extremely shocked that the product, not as advertised, was found <u>of poor quality / mutilated</u> since the day I bought it.

服务: I had been kept waiting for an unbearably long time until I received your <u>service / package</u>, and the manner of your staff was far from satisfying.

环境: the 环境问题 has long been a headache in <u>our neighborhood</u>. Worse still, it shows signs of deterioration recently.

On the other, despite my repetitive complaints, the department concerned seemed to have attached little attention to it. Feeling disappointed, I demand that the issue be solved as soon as possible (,or I will resort to the law / higher authorities). 

I would appreciate it if you could take my complaints into serious consideration and make efforts to prevent recurrence of the problem. I'm looking forward to your early reply.

Yours sincerely,

Li Ming

Dear xxx,

(拒绝信) I'm Li Ming writing on receipt of your letter. I really appreciate your cordial offer to the <u>position / activity</u>.

(辞职信) I'm Li Ming working as a ×× in our company. I really appreciate the opportunity to have worked with such an extraordinary group.

I'm quite reluctant to inform you that I wont be available for the <u>activity / job</u>. The foremost reason is that <u>活动主题/工作名称</u> is not in line with my <u>specialty / expectation</u>; therefore, it would be unwise for me to <u>engage in / carry on</u> what I'm not good at. Worse still, I have been assigned an urgent task by my university, which deprived me of the time and energy to <u>accept the offer / work for yo</u>u. To make up the <u>inconvenience / trouble / loss</u> I cause, I'd like to recommend Mr. Smith to take my place.

Again, I must apologize for having to <u>decline your kind offer / resign from the post</u>. I wish you continued success in the future.

Yours faithfully,

I hope you will find the above-mentioned useful and practical. May all go well with you!

I'm extremely sorry that 所要抱歉的事. I hereby apologize with some embarrassment and many apologies.

There were several causes leading to the <u>incident / my fault</u>.

Although I tried every remedy I could, what was done could not be undone.

I apologize for the <u>trouble / loss</u> I caused and assure you that all possible measures will be taken to compensate. I sincerely hope that you will be able to think in my shoes and accept my apology.

描图. The picture, simple but thought-provoking，illustrates a prevalent phenomenon, namely, 主题词. As for me, it is a matter that deserves extra attention.

Sever factors, I beieve, can be easily found to account for <u>my point / the phenomenon</u>, among which I will name three extremely significant ones as follows. First and foremost, 主题, as a result of multiple reasons, inevitably <u>brings tremendous benefits to I poses tremendous impact on / causes tremendous harm to</u> each modern soul('s <u>financial state/health condition / academic performance / career path</u>) By the same token, seeing that 主题 is a <u>blessing / basis / curse / challenge</u> to <u>the nation's prosperity and harmony / the survival and development of every group / the education of the next generation / enrichment of the culture / environmental and ecological balance / interpersonal relationship</u>, it is also acknowledged as a <u>necessity / gem / poison / conundrum</u> of this era. Last but not least, sb. will <u>be blessed with / suffer from</u> 某情感 if they <u>can / cannot / always / never do sth.</u>. <u>Thus, the quality / experience / choice / phenomenon</u> is no wonder <u>rewarding / comforting / worrying / prevalent</u> and its influence can be far-reaching.

The above-mentioned can safely lead us to the conclusion that 主题 indeed merits our contemplation in more ways than one. (建议: As far as I'm concerned, it is high time that the authorities set up effective regulations and organized various activities on a regular basis. In terms of the individuals, attaching due attention to it may be the first step towards improvement.) In a
nutshell, only through putting things into perspective can we embrace a brighter future.

**让步论点**：负面主题 seemingly has no ground for harsh <u>judgement / counts</u> no serious misdeed, but when subjected to careful reflection, it will prove to be the sword of Damocles threatening the long-term <u>development / wellbeing</u> of many individuals and even the nation as a whole.

**万能例子**: The <u>story / legend / scandal</u> of xx is a case in point. It was exactly 主题 that contributed to his <u>success / failure / doom</u>. It is by no means an isolated instance, but one witnessed in all aspects of our life.

**外因——经济基础**: Just as Karl Marx once put it, "the economic basis determines the superstructure". In similar fashion, it was the <u>improvement of the living standards / upgradation of the infrastructure / rapid development of science and technology</u> that made 主题 affordable to <u>the general public(s.b.)</u>.

**外因——全球大势**：The momentum of <u>cultural blending / globalization / division of labor</u> becoming irresistible <u>xx has become possible(affordable) for the general public instead of being exclusive to those at the top of the pyramid. / our lifestyle(lifegoals) has fundamentally diversified accordingly</u>.


**外因——政策风潮**：<u>The incentive policies issued by the government to stimulate 主题 / The strict laws issued by the government against 主题 / The lack of supervision over 主题 / The vigorous propaganda of 主题 / The accelerating pace of life (and the growing pressure from all sides)</u> over the years <u>have / has</u> been an invisible hand to shape sb.'s <u>behavior / choice / mentality / preference</u> and therefore contributed to such a wide-spread (and <u>comforting / worrying</u>) phenomenon.

**内因——重视程度**：Some people are (not) keenly aware of the <u>significance / value / harm / whole picture</u> of <u>主题</u>. <u>After all</u>, (according to <u>Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs / Joel Feinberg's psychological egoistic hedonism</u>,) it is human nature to <u>pursue self-actualization and public recognition / pursue higher levels of enjoyment when their basic needs are met / focus only on the present interest (convenience / condition) / do all that they can to shirk all labor(duty)</u>.

**内因——观点改变**：Another subtle reason lies in the psychological transformation that a wealth of sb. <u>no longer / tend to</u> regard 主题 <u>as an indispensable virtue (quality) / an ideal means to do sth / a symbol of the status</u>; hence it has gradually <u>become their new favorite / become a necessity / lost popularity</u>.

**内因——时间精力**：With mounting (diminishing) <u>time and energy (income) at their disposal / burden on their shoulders</u>, 某人 are inevitably <u>blessed with / deprived of</u> (more) opportunities to enjoy themselves / improve themselves / try new things.

**利弊——个人利害**：A number of individuals (,especially sb.,) are the most typical <u>beneficiaries / victims</u> of 主题 in that they could (not) enjoy the best things that the world can offer with (without) it.

**利弊——情感因素**：The majority of 某人 are bound to be <u>blessed with / suffer from / indulge</u> in the sense of 情感 if they could(not) do sth.. Therefore, the phenomenon is <u>thought-provoking / cheering / alarming / worrying</u> and its influence can be far-reaching.

**利弊——社会生态**：Considering that 主题 <u>boasts incomparable value to /poses tremendous risk to / exerts enormous impact on the prosperity and harmony of the society / the cohesion of every group / the education of the next generation / the cultural diffusion and diversity / the ecological balance</u>, it is no wonder acknowledged as a <u>gem / requisite /poison / conundrum</u> of this era.

**推导展望**: It can be deduced from the picture that <u>diverse attitudes toward 主题 will continue to exist / 主题 is to be pushed to a new high / even more people will choose to do sth. (devote themseives to doing sth.) / countermeasures will be taken against the issue</u> in the near future. That being the case, we foresee <u>a / no</u> dramatic change of the <u>data / phenomenon</u> in the years to come.

### 7.3.5 第三段

**第九句**：

1. From the previous discussion we can safely come to the conclusion that 主题 indeed merits our contemplation in more ways than one.
2. The above-mentioned can naturlly lead us to the conclusion that 主题's strengths far outweigh its drawbacks.
3. The analysis above may reasonably come to the conclusion that 主题 was, is, and will continue to be indispensable to every 4. From the previous discussion we can safely come to the conclusion that 主题 will continue to influence all aspects of our e in the long run.

**建议**：

1. It is high time we cultivated a better awareness of it and channeled actions in the light of concrete circumstances.
2. It is advisable that every nation on the globe framed a correct concept.
3. It is advised for educators at every level to put premium on the phenomenon and adopt an appropriate strategy to address the problem.
4. Joint efforts should be made by the government and the society. The former is responsible for issuing effective laws to discipline misdeeds; the latter, as the first step towards the improvement of the situation, is to infuse correct awareness of the topic into everyone.

**最后一句**：

1. Bearing the previous points in mind, we can spend our life happily and meaningfully.
